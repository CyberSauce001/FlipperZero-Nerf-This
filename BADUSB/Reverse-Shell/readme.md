<h1> Work in Progress</h1>

You will require an offensive attack machine, ideally Kali Linux or Parrot OS, pick whichever you prefer. You will also need a designated target platform, preferably Windows 10 or 11.
This script is use to create a reverse shell using Hoaxshell from https://github.com/t3l3machus/hoaxshell.

If you don't know what this is please go to his github and read up on it, but tdlr you inject a payload which goes undetected against Windows Defender and gain access to target system. 
There are three scripts two that runs on powershell and another run on cmd.

Will try to run it using Task Scheduler to have persistance on it, after payload is injected. More on it later and will finish writing the rest of this. 


Will be tidying up the readme.md as I am testing out the script and modifying it.
