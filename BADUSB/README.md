# Killing a Single Process Event for Windows 10/11

Credits to Alessandro Greco aka Aleff.

SCript is modified by me, to make sure that it is working as intended, as it did not execute properly for Windows 11. 
Make sure to modify Line 52 for Kill-Single-Process.txt to what task you want to close. Example msedge.exe.


Windows 11 - Successful
Windows 10 testing is in progress.
