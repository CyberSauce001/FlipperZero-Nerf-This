# Killing a Single Process Event for Windows 10/11

Credits to [Aleff](https://github.com/aleff-github)

Script is modified by me, to make sure that it is working as intended, as it did not execute properly for Windows 11.<br>
Make sure to modify Line 52 for Kill-Single-Process.txt to the task you want to close. Example msedge.exe.<br>
In case the script is running too fast, increase the delay value.

Windows 11 - Successful<br>
Windows 10 testing is in progress.
