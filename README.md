# FlipperZero Collection of Flipper-Things
## Collection of Flipper Zero things for my personal preferences and educational purposes.

Please note that if you are to use any of the script to give proper credit to either myself or other users/creator that is mention on the repo of files themselves.
I am not held responsible if you are to use the script for any malicious or illegal activites. This is purely educational, and a learning experience. 


Learn as you go and have fun. 
- Updates may happen weekly. As I also working on other projects.
- Will create my own custom firmware (self-taught, not going great) if you have created, know someone, or come across a source to creating a firmware.
  Please send them my way. I want to learn and create something cool for everyone.


Happy Flipping ðŸ˜ƒ
